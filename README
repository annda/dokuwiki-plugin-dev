will not work!

Plugin Wizard
=============

This repository serves a dual purpose. It's main purpose it to provide
a plugin for DokuWiki that helps developers to create new plugins. It
also provides the web interface known as the "DokuWiki Plugin Wizard"
available at https://pluginwiz.dokuwiki.org/ - files for that are
in the www subdirectory.

Users of the plugin do not need to bother with the wizard parts (in
fact they are not included in the download when the plugin is installed
via the plugin manager).

If you want to work on the wizard code, you need to install the
dependencies using composer. This is needed because the wizard runs
independent of a DokuWiki installation.

Wizard and plugin only share the skeletons (in the skel directory)
and the Skeletor class which implements the logic for using the
skeletons.
